  About
</H1>

First of all, I want to say a big thank you to OzTamir and his project [Broke](https://github.com/OzTamir/broke) for giving me a running start on my project. 

This app is a pet projet of mine after trying to find a free alternative to brick without any luck. Working off of the Broke project was an introduction to app development for me. Even though I started with and mainly used Broke as a base, learning about swift and Xcode was a fun project and distraction from studying for the LSAT for a while.

While the app is functional, I could never do what the team at Brick could do. You should still consider supporting them [Here](https://getbrick.app/shop)

  Features
</H1>
Like Broke, the features consist of:

- Minimalist Design  
- Open Source  
- Multiple Profiles  
- Creating your own NFC tag  

I also added a custom shield configuration to display a custom lock screen over locked apps.
