# About

First of all, I want to say a big thank you to OzTamir and his project [Broke](https://github.com/OzTamir/broke) for giving me a running start on my project.

This app is a pet project of mine after trying to find a free alternative to Brick without any luck. Working off the Broke project was an introduction to app development for me. Even though I started with and mainly used Broke as a base, learning about Swift and Xcode was a fun project and a distraction from studying for the LSAT for a while.

While the app is functional, I could never do what the team at Brick could do. You should still consider supporting them [here](https://getbrick.app/shop).

# Features

Like Broke, the features consist of:

- Minimalist Design  
- Open Source  
- Multiple Profiles  
- Creating your own NFC tag  

I also added a custom shield configuration to display a custom lock screen over locked apps.

# Future Plans

I am planning to add a way to schedule locking.

# Make Your Own Version

1. Clone the repository  
2. Open in Xcode  
3. Mess around with it yourself and make whatever you want
