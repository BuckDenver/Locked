### 💡 Tips

- Keep your NFC tag in a slightly inconvenient place (across the room, in a drawer) to add intentional friction
- Use Allow Mode for maximum focus during important work sessions
- Create different profiles for different parts of your day
- Check your snooze usage to track how often you're breaking your locks
